# Tableau-Visualization-With-My-LinkedIn-Data

As a data analyst, I am always looking for ways to improve my skills. So this time I thought of making a Tableau dashboard showing the most interesting metrics of my very own LinkedIn Data

What insights did I derive from my LinkedIn Data?
1. Gowtham Genpur, is my top buddy! He's a good friend and excellent resource for all things data 🙏🏼
2. I have the most connections at companies where I have worked/studied or where I would like to work.
3. My busiest month making connections was May, 2021. I made 68 connections in one month (Thanks, to my summer vacation 😂)
4. Most of my connections are Data Analysts followed by Data Scientists

In this Tableau project, I practiced:
1. Downloading LinkedIn data into CSV files
2. Using the conditions filter on a tree map
3. Using generic desktop size and floating worksheets in a dashboard
