Swaminathan,Chandrasekaran,Freshworks,Senior Product Manager,"My very first memory of Raghul is when I interviewed him for his position at Freshworks. He not only answered my questions but the analogies he gave drawing parallels to the real-world examples was the point that made me ascertain his ability to break complex problems. He possesses very good communication skills and would articulate his answers both clearly and concisely.   Raghul is always positive and has a deep interest in learning with the desire to know more about technology and understanding business processes. He knows his responsibilities and does justice to the title.     Having observed Raghul’s deep-rooted interest in SaaS applications, I would often hold discussions with him about product enhancements that helped us build a well-defined product roadmap. He has a wealth of information about the business challenges that customers face and comes up with fitting solutions that reassure their confidence. He helps us close the loop and build better features for our customers by providing continuous feedback to the product and engineering teams. I believe his ideas and contributions were crucial in refining our product and user experience.  Also, he's a person who never runs out of gas and maintains the same energy right from the beginning of the day till closure. Being a cloud-based product, interruptions and unforeseen downtimes are bound to happen but Raghul proactively communicates to the customers mitigating the impact on their businesses, and coordinates with the product teams to bring out a quick resolution.    It was indeed a great experience knowing and working with Raghul. ","09/15/21, 04:37 AM",VISIBLE
