Actually, I left Apple recently. After 8 years in recruiting, I decided to leave my position and coach candidates full time.   As a candidate there are a number of hurdles and challenges when it comes to applying for a job. It can be discouraging to spend so much time and effort to apply for roles but never hear back or to finally get the opportunity to interview but not receive an offer after all the time invested. I receive messages from candidates every day asking for help and advice on how to land a job in tech. I wish I could help everyone but at this time, I only have bandwidth to help clients that I work with 1 on 1.   If you’re interested in working together, you can fill out the form below to request a free consult call. This will help both of us determine if we are a good fit to work together. I only work with candidates who are serious and committed to implementing my strategies and techniques. If you are only passively looking at the moment, feel free to submit the form in the future when you’re ready.   https://form.candidatecareercoach.com/freeconsult  Thanks again for reaching out.

How is the course/faculty/University in general? The course and faculty are really nice and good quality of education but there’s no flexibility in choosing your own courses. They are predefined   2. Could you share an approximate split-up of the expenses other than the course fee? (stay/insurance/grocery/others) I know this would differ based on individuals but a rough quote would help me with my loan process. And what are the places to look out for stay? Rent - Parkside $500 (currently the apartments are under renovation so the rent will increase in the near future), Graduate Hill and Graduate Gardens - (2 bed 1 bath apts) total apt cost $1400, rent will depend on the number of people you share it with. Other than that groceries and utilities should not be more than $300/ month  3.  Ppl say that most of the jobs in Maryland are federal so it's really difficult to land in a private job/internship. How is the job scenario at umd? The course duration is 16 months. Will that be an issue in finding a job/internship as most jobs are available in the summer. The location doesn’t matter that much, people get jobs internships all over the US.  And there are a lot of companies non- govt non- fedral that are there in DC, Maryland and Virginia.  4. Actually, my UG was diff. from this but I've been working as a product consultant in an IT company so I am not much into technical side. Will that be an obstacle for me during the course or will it be taught from the scratch? You could recommend courses that you feel one should study beforehand. The courses are designed in a way that it wouldn’t be a problem for you to learn but you’ll have to put in more efforts apart from your other batch mates.  5. How helpful is the career services team and do companies come for job fairs to UMD?  Not that much, they don’t have connections with companies to get our foot in the door  6. What's the avg. class size like? 60  7. Do enough ppl get GA or on-campus jobs? What kind of roles are available and what is the pay like? (Asking bcoz UMD seems quite expensive, have to compensate 😅) Yes, they do. On campus jobs are available in abundance but only if you try for them. I’ve had no problem getting on campus jobs since the day I started at UMD. Ask for TA, RA and GA in all the schools not just the Smith School.   8. When do we do our internships and what is the right time to start applying? As soon as possible, I’d say you can start in August because all the big companies hire in fall for their summer internships",INBOX

So, GA position are given out with admission letter. There are few GA positions only. The general pay is around $15-$20 per hour for GA.   Generally people Start applying around Nov.

The courses/faculty is quite good. You need to approach them if you need help, they will always do whatever they can to help you. I will say good repo with professor help you in the long run.  2.	Insurance charges vary greatly from what type of health insurance you take. It is approx. from $800-1600 per year. Groceries around $100-$150 monthly. Monthly rent also varies from $400-$800 where you stay. I have an apartment that I will be subletting let me know if you are interested. Here the monthly rent is $500 3.	From my perspective, I would say that location sometimes matters. Because here is DMV area most of the jobs are federal jobs i.e. they require some kind of security clearance. And as international students, we do not have that. So, certainly finding a job is not a piece of cake. But still, there are a few startups in the DMV area that might be willing to offer some roles to international students. 4.	If you want a career in the data analysis domain you can start working on your python, SQL, R, Tableau, etc. skills. Learn from online courses and then try doing passion projects which actually have some value and you can talk about it in an interview. Because if you don’t have experience directly related to the job you want a career in, it gets really difficult to land a job. So, it's important to have some projects to back you up. 5.	Literally very few people get jobs from career fairs. Most companies in UMD career fair do not provide sponsorship. And smith school has a different career fair where MS students can go. There are other career fairs which are better but you aren't allowed to go to those fairs. But as I said the number of people getting a job through fairs is really less. So, you are on your own to find a job. They have a career portal known as Hiresmith, which they will boost about in the orientation but there are very fewer job postings on that portal and most of the posting requires experience. 6.	Around 80-100",INBOX

Could you share an approximate split-up of the expenses other than the course fees? (stay/insurance/grocery/others) I know this would differ based on individuals but a rough quote would help me with my loan process.  A: Most of the Indians stay at Graduate Hills and Gardens and apply very early like in April/May because its difficult to get an apartment here. If you live in shared space your rent would be around $360 and for private around $450 but again it depends how you split the rent. I had taken ISO insurance which was cheapest of all. $500 for 6 months or so. University insurance is expensive. Grocery for a month would be around $200 maybe. So overall $650-$700 a month. It would be more if you choose to stay at some other place.   2.  Ppl say that most of the jobs in Maryland are federal so it's really difficult to land in a private job/internship. How is the job scenario at umd? The course duration is 16 months. Will that be an issue in finding a job/internship as most jobs are available in the summer.  A: I have answered this idk 10 times at least to different people. Location has NO impact on your job unless you are targeting any startup. Even those are fine as long as you don't require relocation expense. You have to work hard to get a job. Same is true for any university in Cali or NY. Location does not give you a job. 16 month duration doesn't make any difference on job prospects.   3. How is the course/faculty/University in general (UMD seems to be quite expensive than other univs 😓) It is expensive because the course is provided by business school. If you applied to MSIM then it would have been cheaper. Some faculty are good some are okayish. But scores/GPA doesn't matter as long as you have 3.3+.  4. Actually, my UG was in chemical engg. but I'm working as a product consultant in an IT company so I am not much into technical side. Will that be an obstacle for me during the course or will it be taught from the scratch? You could recommend courses that you feel one should study before coming.. A: That should not be a problem. You will learn as you go. However, if you get time do some SQL and Python courses. If interested I will provide you with specific names.  5. How helpful is the career services team and do companies come for job fairs to UMD? A: I am not gonna lie. They are not really good. But its my view. For some people it was really good. It really depends on your participation in their seminars etc. I did not attend any so I am not the best person to answer.",INBOX

In order to enable production, you must have clear, precise drawings that are easy to interpret. In layman’s terms, drafting standards still matter. Modern design solutions have an arsenal of tools to create incredible drawings – automatic view creation, auto-dimensioning, parts-lists templates, title-block templates, section-view commands, auxiliary-view commands, tolerance analysis and more.</p><p>But the ease-of-use of these tools can cause the user to underestimate the technical knowledge needed to use them properly. Regardless of the software or technology used, even seemingly minor errors – an arrow pointing in the wrong direction or a misplaced view – can cause major issues in manufacturability. Detailed, accurate drawings are less likely to be misinterpreted, which means it is less likely they will cause the costly re-manufacture of parts.</p><p>Download the white paper today to learn techniques for streamlining the creation of&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener"" href=""https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/topic/cad-drawings/10514?stc=wwdi100222"" target=""_blank"">production-ready CAD drawings.</a></p><p>Best,</p><p>Oliver Duncan</p><p>Product Manager of Solid Edge Design Products at Siemens PLM Software</p>",ARCHIVE
